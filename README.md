# github-favorites
An application that allows you to select the people you like the most in Github.

- I made this web application during the Explorer course from Rocketseat
- It is a SPA built using html css and javascript
- In Github Favorites you can add your favorite developers in Github by just writing their usernames and clicking on the + button
- The users you add will be on a table list and you can also remove them if you want to, so they will disappear immediatly
